Building a single game of TicTacToe using stream sockets. A game server supports multiple games via multithreading. The user connects to the server and is asked to input their desired username, at which point the server waits for another user to connect. Upon that completing, the game begins. The game ends either when a playerâ€™s opponent plays three marks in a row, or there is a tie.
